REPUTE
======

A Decentralized Reputation System Smart Contract

* * * * *

Overview
--------

REPUTE is a robust, decentralized smart contract designed to manage user reputation across multiple domains. It enables users to stake tokens, earn and update reputation scores, endorse peers, and resolve disputes-all in a trustless, transparent manner. The contract is ideal for decentralized applications (dApps), DAOs, and any platform seeking reliable, on-chain reputation management.

Features
--------

-   **Multi-Domain Reputation:** Supports multiple reputation domains (e.g., Technical Skills, Communication, Reliability, Quality of Work).

-   **Staking Mechanism:** Users must stake tokens to participate, ensuring skin in the game and discouraging malicious actions.

-   **Reputation Updates:** Users can update reputation scores for others, subject to staking and cooling periods.

-   **Endorsements:** Peer-to-peer endorsements with configurable weights.

-   **Dispute Resolution:** Comprehensive dispute system allowing challenges, arbitration, and transparent resolution.

-   **Owner Controls:** Contract owner can initialize and add new reputation domains.

**Prerequisites:**

-   Clarity-compatible blockchain (e.g., Stacks)

**Deployment:**

1.  Deploy the contract to your preferred Clarity blockchain.
